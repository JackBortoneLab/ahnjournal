    - The prefix for your crossref account, usually 10.XXXX
- Crossref Registrant
    - The name of the registrant for this journal on Crossref's system eg. Open Library of Humanities
- DOI Display Prefix
    - Text to prepend to DOIs, this is used to generate DOI URLs

Minting DOIs is covered in Articles and Issues.
